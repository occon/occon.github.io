Analysis of SARS-CoV -2 using R to study the data obtained with some variants of the virus.
Obtained DNA sequences, created fasta files, displayed data comparison for each DNA sequence and established phylogenetic relationships.

Worked on the project from March 2021 to April 2021. You can view the repository I worked on by clicking [here](https://github.com/occon/COVID-19-R-Analysis).
